  "summary": "Humans perceive the world through multiple senses, enabling them to create a\ncomprehensive representation of their surroundings and to generalize\ninformation across domains. For instance, when a textual description of a scene\nis given, humans can mentally visualize it. In fields like robotics and\nReinforcement Learning (RL), agents can also access information about the\nenvironment through multiple sensors; yet redundancy and complementarity\nbetween sensors is difficult to exploit as a source of robustness (e.g. against\nsensor failure) or generalization (e.g. transfer across domains). Prior\nresearch demonstrated that a robust and flexible multimodal representation can\nbe efficiently constructed based on the cognitive science notion of a 'Global\nWorkspace': a unique representation trained to combine information across\nmodalities, and to broadcast its signal back to each modality. Here, we explore\nwhether such a brain-inspired multimodal representation could be advantageous\nfor RL agents. First, we train a 'Global Workspace' to exploit information\ncollected about the environment via two input modalities (a visual input, or an\nattribute vector representing the state of the agent and/or its environment).\nThen, we train a RL agent policy using this frozen Global Workspace. In two\ndistinct environments and tasks, our results reveal the model's ability to\nperform zero-shot cross-modal transfer between input modalities, i.e. to apply\nto image inputs a policy previously trained on attribute vectors (and\nvice-versa), without additional training or fine-tuning. Variants and ablations\nof the full Global Workspace (including a CLIP-like multimodal representation\ntrained via contrastive learning) did not display the same generalization\nabilities.",
