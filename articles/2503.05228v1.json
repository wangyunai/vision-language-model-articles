  "summary": "Recipe image generation is an important challenge in food computing, with\napplications from culinary education to interactive recipe platforms. However,\nthere is currently no real-world dataset that comprehensively connects recipe\ngoals, sequential steps, and corresponding images. To address this, we\nintroduce RecipeGen, the first real-world goal-step-image benchmark for recipe\ngeneration, featuring diverse ingredients, varied recipe steps, multiple\ncooking styles, and a broad collection of food categories. Data is in\nhttps://github.com/zhangdaxia22/RecipeGen.",
