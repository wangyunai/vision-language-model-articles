  "summary": "In the domain of music production and audio processing, the implementation of\nautomatic pitch correction of the singing voice, also known as Auto-Tune, has\nsignificantly transformed the landscape of vocal performance. While auto-tuning\ntechnology has offered musicians the ability to tune their vocal pitches and\nachieve a desired level of precision, its use has also sparked debates\nregarding its impact on authenticity and artistic integrity. As a result,\ndetecting and analyzing Auto-Tuned vocals in music recordings has become\nessential for music scholars, producers, and listeners. However, to the best of\nour knowledge, no prior effort has been made in this direction. This study\nintroduces a data-driven approach leveraging triplet networks for the detection\nof Auto-Tuned songs, backed by the creation of a dataset composed of original\nand Auto-Tuned audio clips. The experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method in both accuracy and robustness compared to\nRawnet2, an end-to-end model proposed for anti-spoofing and widely used for\nother audio forensic tasks.",
