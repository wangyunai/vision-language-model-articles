  "summary": "In this paper, we introduce a privacy-preserving stable diffusion framework\nleveraging homomorphic encryption, called HE-Diffusion, which primarily focuses\non protecting the denoising phase of the diffusion process. HE-Diffusion is a\ntailored encryption framework specifically designed to align with the unique\narchitecture of stable diffusion, ensuring both privacy and functionality. To\naddress the inherent computational challenges, we propose a novel\nmin-distortion method that enables efficient partial image encryption,\nsignificantly reducing the overhead without compromising the model's output\nquality. Furthermore, we adopt a sparse tensor representation to expedite\ncomputational operations, enhancing the overall efficiency of the\nprivacy-preserving diffusion process. We successfully implement HE-based\nprivacy-preserving stable diffusion inference. The experimental results show\nthat HE-Diffusion achieves 500 times speedup compared with the baseline method,\nand reduces time cost of the homomorphically encrypted inference to the minute\nlevel. Both the performance and accuracy of the HE-Diffusion are on par with\nthe plaintext counterpart. Our approach marks a significant step towards\nintegrating advanced cryptographic techniques with state-of-the-art generative\nmodels, paving the way for privacy-preserving and efficient image generation in\ncritical applications.",
