  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing bioinformatics, enabling\nadvanced analysis of DNA, RNA, proteins, and single-cell data. This survey\nprovides a systematic review of recent advancements, focusing on genomic\nsequence modeling, RNA structure prediction, protein function inference, and\nsingle-cell transcriptomics. Meanwhile, we also discuss several key challenges,\nincluding data scarcity, computational complexity, and cross-omics integration,\nand explore future directions such as multimodal learning, hybrid AI models,\nand clinical applications. By offering a comprehensive perspective, this paper\nunderscores the transformative potential of LLMs in driving innovations in\nbioinformatics and precision medicine.",
