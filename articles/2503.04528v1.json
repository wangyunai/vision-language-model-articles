  "summary": "This paper presents an advanced Federated Learning (FL) framework for\nforecasting complex spatiotemporal data, improving upon recent state-of-the-art\nmodels. In the proposed approach, the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\nmodule within previous Dynamic Spatial--Temporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent\nNetwork (DSTGCRN) modeling is first replaced with a Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) network, enabling the resulting model to more effectively capture\nlong-term dependencies inherent to time series data. The resulting architecture\nsignificantly improves the model's capacity to handle complex temporal patterns\nin diverse forecasting applications. Furthermore, the proposed FL framework\nintegrates a novel Client-Side Validation (CSV) mechanism, introducing a\ncritical validation step at the client level before incorporating aggregated\nparameters from the central server into local models. This ensures that only\nthe most effective updates are adopted, improving both the robustness and\naccuracy of the forecasting model across clients. The efficiency of our\napproach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on real-world\napplications, including public datasets for multimodal transport demand\nforecasting and private datasets for Origin-Destination (OD) matrix forecasting\nin urban areas. The results demonstrate substantial improvements over\nconventional methods, highlighting the framework's ability to capture complex\nspatiotemporal dependencies while preserving data privacy. This work not only\nprovides a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for real-time,\nregion-specific forecasting and management but also underscores the potential\nof leveraging distributed data sources in a FL context. We provide our\nalgorithms as open-source on GitHub.",
