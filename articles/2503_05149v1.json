  "summary": "This research focuses on the development and enhancement of text-to-image\ndenoising diffusion models, addressing key challenges such as limited sample\ndiversity and training instability. By incorporating Classifier-Free Guidance\n(CFG) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) techniques, this study significantly\nimproves image quality, diversity, and stability. Utilizing Hugging Face's\nstate-of-the-art text-to-image generation model, the proposed enhancements\nestablish new benchmarks in generative AI. This work explores the underlying\nprinciples of diffusion models, implements advanced strategies to overcome\nexisting limitations, and presents a comprehensive evaluation of the\nimprovements achieved. Results demonstrate substantial progress in generating\nstable, diverse, and high-quality images from textual descriptions, advancing\nthe field of generative artificial intelligence and providing new foundations\nfor future applications.\n  Keywords: Text-to-image, Diffusion model, Classifier-free guidance,\nExponential moving average, Image generation.",
