  "summary": "Advancing AI in computational pathology requires large, high-quality, and\ndiverse datasets, yet existing public datasets are often limited in organ\ndiversity, class coverage, or annotation quality. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce SPIDER (Supervised Pathology Image-DEscription Repository), the\nlargest publicly available patch-level dataset covering multiple organ types,\nincluding Skin, Colorectal, and Thorax, with comprehensive class coverage for\neach organ. SPIDER provides high-quality annotations verified by expert\npathologists and includes surrounding context patches, which enhance\nclassification performance by providing spatial context.\n  Alongside the dataset, we present baseline models trained on SPIDER using the\nHibou-L foundation model as a feature extractor combined with an\nattention-based classification head. The models achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple tissue categories and serve as strong benchmarks\nfor future digital pathology research. Beyond patch classification, the model\nenables rapid identification of significant areas, quantitative tissue metrics,\nand establishes a foundation for multimodal approaches.\n  Both the dataset and trained models are publicly available to advance\nresearch, reproducibility, and AI-driven pathology development.
